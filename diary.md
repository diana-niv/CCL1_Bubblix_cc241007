# Game Development Diary

## 13/01:
Today, I began working on the base code and logic for the game. I used Lukas's code as a foundation and started modifying it to suit the specific needs of my project.

## 14/01:
I finished the base code today and shifted my focus to the art side of the game. I started by drawing the main character, a wizard. It took some time to get the look right, but by the end of the day, I was happy with how it turned out.

## 15/01:
I completed the design of the wizard and moved on to creating a walking animation sprite sheet.

## 16/01:
Today, I drew all the remaining elements that will be present in the game, including various objects in the wizard’s workshop. I also worked on drawing the background.

## 17/01:
I implemented all the artwork into the game, which made it feel much more complete. Then, I focused on coding the collision detection, ensuring that the wizard couldn’t pass through objects like the drawer, bookcase, table, etc. I also started developing the code to display hints during gameplay.

## 18/01:
I worked on the code to ensure that hints disappear after being shown and began creating the animation for the cauldron. Drawing the cauldron sprite sheet was a bit tricky, but I managed to finish it by the end of the day.

## 19/01:
I had some issues with the cauldron animation today, and needed to draw some adjustments. By the end of the day, I was able to resolve the problems and finish the animation.

## 20/01:
Today, I created the actual hints and riddles that players will encounter during the game and started implementing them into the code. This was something that contributed a lot when it came to the progress on the interactivity of the game.

## 21/01:
I had some difficulties implementing the correct font to display the hints, which took longer than expected. In addition, I redesigned the background and made it look lighter so that the objects in the workshop are distinguishable, which made the game look better. I also started working on implementing a points system for players to collect ingredients, establishing a winning condition, as well as a timer to create a losing condition.

## 22/01:
The main focus today was finishing the code for the winning condition. I ran into challenges with the logic behind it but, with help from lecturers, friends, and AI, I was able to fix the problem and move forward.

## 23/01:
I worked on creating the start screen, win screen, and lose screen for the game today and successfully implemented all of them.

## 24/01:
Today was the day I presented the game and also managed to play my colleagues' games.
